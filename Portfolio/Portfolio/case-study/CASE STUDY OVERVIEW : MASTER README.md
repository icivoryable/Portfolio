# Technology Business Analysis for a Privacy-Sensitive Productivity Platform

Technology Business Analysis for a Privacy-Sensitive Productivity Platform

Context
This case study represents business analysis work performed in support of a technology platform developed by Able.ai. The platform operates in a privacy-sensitive environment and serves users who experience fluctuating cognitive capacity during task-based work.
The objective of this engagement was to translate stakeholder needs into clear requirements, process workflows, and validation artifacts that supported delivery while maintaining accessibility, user autonomy, and data protection constraints.
Note: All materials have been redacted and/or simulated to remove proprietary information.

My Role
	•	Business requirements elicitation and documentation
	•	Process analysis and workflow definition
	•	User story and acceptance criteria development
	•	UAT test scenario definition and traceability
	•	Stakeholder collaboration across product and technical teams

Key Constraints
	•	Privacy-first data handling and explicit user consent
	•	Accessibility and low-cognitive-load interaction requirements
	•	Clear scope boundaries to prevent feature overload
	•	Enterprise-style documentation rigor despite early-stage environment

Artifacts Included
	•	Business Requirements Document (BRD)
	•	As-Is / To-Be Process Map
	•	UAT Test Scenarios and Traceability Matrix

Outcome
These artifacts supported aligned delivery by ensuring shared understanding across stakeholders, reducing ambiguity during development, and enabling structured validation of requirements prior to release.
